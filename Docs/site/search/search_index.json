Working on one point of the star at a time, arrange 5 LEDs in the correct order, noting the position of the triangular cutout. This indicates pin 3, not the usual pin 1. Each point is placed identically. Using tweezers, place one of the capacitors onto the pads, use a coctail stick to hold the component down while removing the tweezers just incase it sticks and lifts away. Place the first LED on the pads closest to the centre of the star, taking care not to have any clothing, jewellery or body parts touch the rest of the PCB.

The reflow oven used here is basically a modified toaster oven with a controller that is programmed to heat up using a generic timing profile. Carefully place on the shelf without touching the components. Close the door. Switch the oven on and Start the program. It is pre-programmed to heat up at a set rate so that the components heat up evenly. When the cycle has finished open the door and allow the PCB to cool down before touching it. At this point the solder is still molten and any movement can dislodge the components. An alternative to the reflow oven is a hotplate, however these have no control over temperature and timings. The hotplate here is too small to fully solder the star and it needs careful handling to ensure it can be fully soldered.","title":"Soldering"},{"location":"front/soldering1/#front-soldering","text":"The PCB can now be soldered using either a reflow oven or a hot plate.

A stainless steel stencil is used to ensure the solderpaste is applied to the component pads. These are normally ordered at the same time as the PCBs. The stencil thickness will determine how much paste is placed onto the pads. The PCB is placed into the front holder, the stencil is placed over the top and a scraper is used to spread the paste across the holes using a single smooth motion. Apply stencil, ensure the pads are visible through the stencil holes. Squeeze out a blob of solderpaste as shown in the circled part. Apply the paste. It can be easier to apply to each star point in turn. Carefuly lift up the stencil. The board should look like this. Close up of the pads. The stencil can be cleaned using IPA and a paper towel ready for the next person to use. Remember to clean both sides.","title":"Solderpaste"},{"location":"front/solderpaste1/#front-solderpaste","text":"Unlike traditional electronics assembly with through hole components, we need to use a solder paste which is made up of tiny balls of solder in a liquid flux to create a spreadable paste.
