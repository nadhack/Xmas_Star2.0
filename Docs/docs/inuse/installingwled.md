# Installing WLED


![WLED Logo](../img/wled_logo.png)

The ESP32 modules supplied with the kits have the WLED firmware pre-installed so they are ready to go.

For completeness, the [WLED website](https://kno.wled.ge/) has a lot of information on setting up and using the software.

The easiest way to load the firmware to a new or existing device is to use the [WLED Web Installer](https://install.wled.me/)
